    <p>
        A high level view for {@link Player} media playbacks. It displays video, subtitles and album art
        during playback, and displays playback controls using a {@link PlayerControlView}.
    </p>

    <p>A PlayerView can be customized by setting attributes (or calling corresponding methods),
        overriding the view's layout file or by specifying a custom view layout file, as outlined below.

        <h3>Attributes</h3>

        The following attributes can be set on a PlayerView when used in a layout XML file:

        <ul>
            <li><b>{@code use_artwork}</b> - Whether artwork is used if available in audio streams.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setUseArtwork(boolean)}
                    <li>Default: {@code true}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code default_artwork}</b> - Default artwork to use if no artwork available in audio
                streams.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setDefaultArtwork(Drawable)}
                    <li>Default: {@code null}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code use_controller}</b> - Whether the playback controls can be shown.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setUseController(boolean)}
                    <li>Default: {@code true}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code hide_on_touch}</b> - Whether the playback controls are hidden by touch events.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setControllerHideOnTouch(boolean)}
                    <li>Default: {@code true}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code auto_show}</b> - Whether the playback controls are automatically shown when
                playback starts, pauses, ends, or fails. If set to false, the playback controls can be
                manually operated with {@link #showController()} and {@link #hideController()}.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setControllerAutoShow(boolean)}
                    <li>Default: {@code true}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code hide_during_ads}</b> - Whether the playback controls are hidden during ads.
                Controls are always shown during ads if they are enabled and the player is paused.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setControllerHideDuringAds(boolean)}
                    <li>Default: {@code true}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code show_buffering}</b> - Whether the buffering spinner is displayed when the player
                is buffering. Valid values are {@code never}, {@code when_playing} and {@code always}.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setShowBuffering(int)}
                    <li>Default: {@code never}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code resize_mode}</b> - Controls how video and album art is resized within the view.
                Valid values are {@code fit}, {@code fixed_width}, {@code fixed_height} and {@code fill}.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setResizeMode(int)}
                    <li>Default: {@code fit}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code surface_type}</b> - The type of surface view used for video playbacks. Valid
                values are {@code surface_view}, {@code texture_view}, {@code spherical_view} and {@code
                none}. Using {@code none} is recommended for audio only applications, since creating the
                surface can be expensive. Using {@code surface_view} is recommended for video applications.
                Note, TextureView can only be used in a hardware accelerated window. When rendered in
                software, TextureView will draw nothing.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: None
                    <li>Default: {@code surface_view}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code shutter_background_color}</b> - The background color of the {@code exo_shutter}
                view.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setShutterBackgroundColor(int)}
                    <li>Default: {@code unset}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code keep_content_on_player_reset}</b> - Whether the currently displayed video frame
                or media artwork is kept visible when the player is reset.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: {@link #setKeepContentOnPlayerReset(boolean)}
                    <li>Default: {@code false}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code player_layout_id}</b> - Specifies the id of the layout to be inflated. See below
                for more details.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: None
                    <li>Default: {@code R.layout.exo_player_view}
                </ul>
            <li><b>{@code controller_layout_id}</b> - Specifies the id of the layout resource to be
                inflated by the child {@link PlayerControlView}. See below for more details.
                <ul>
                    <li>Corresponding method: None
                    <li>Default: {@code R.layout.exo_player_control_view}
                </ul>
            <li>All attributes that can be set on a {@link PlayerControlView} can also be set on a
                PlayerView, and will be propagated to the inflated {@link PlayerControlView} unless the
                layout is overridden to specify a custom {@code exo_controller} (see below).
        </ul>

        <h3>Overriding the layout file</h3>

        To customize the layout of PlayerView throughout your app, or just for certain configurations,
        you can define {@code exo_player_view.xml} layout files in your application {@code res/layout }
        directories. These layouts will override the one provided by the ExoPlayer library, and will be
        inflated for use by PlayerView. The view identifies and binds its children by looking for the
        following ids:

        <p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_content_frame}</b> - A frame whose aspect ratio is resized based on the video
                    or album art of the media being played, and the configured {@code resize_mode}. The video
                    surface view is inflated into this frame as its first child.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link AspectRatioFrameLayout}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_shutter}</b> - A view that's made visible when video should be hidden. This
                    view is typically an opaque view that covers the video surface, thereby obscuring it when
                    visible. Obscuring the surface in this way also helps to prevent flicker at the start of
                    playback when {@code surface_type="surface_view"}.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link View}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_buffering}</b> - A view that's made visible when the player is buffering.
                    This view typically displays a buffering spinner or animation.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link View}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_subtitles}</b> - Displays subtitles.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link SubtitleView}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_artwork}</b> - Displays album art.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link ImageView}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_error_message}</b> - Displays an error message to the user if playback fails.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link TextView}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_controller_placeholder}</b> - A placeholder that's replaced with the inflated
                    {@link PlayerControlView}. Ignored if an {@code exo_controller} view exists.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link View}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_controller}</b> - An already inflated {@link PlayerControlView}. Allows use
                    of a custom extension of {@link PlayerControlView}. Note that attributes such as {@code
                    rewind_increment} will not be automatically propagated through to this instance. If a view
                    exists with this id, any {@code exo_controller_placeholder} view will be ignored.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link PlayerControlView}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_ad_overlay}</b> - A {@link FrameLayout} positioned on top of the player which
                    is used to show ad UI (if applicable).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link FrameLayout}
                    </ul>
                <li><b>{@code exo_overlay}</b> - A {@link FrameLayout} positioned on top of the player which
                    the app can access via {@link #getOverlayFrameLayout()}, provided for convenience.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Type: {@link FrameLayout}
                    </ul>
            </ul>

            <p>All child views are optional and so can be omitted if not required, however where defined they
                must be of the expected type.

                <h3>Specifying a custom layout file</h3>

                Defining your own {@code exo_player_view.xml} is useful to customize the layout of PlayerView
                throughout your application. It's also possible to customize the layout for a single instance in
                a layout file. This is achieved by setting the {@code player_layout_id} attribute on a
                PlayerView. This will cause the specified layout to be inflated instead of {@code
                exo_player_view.xml} for only the instance on which the attribute is set.
